# Neural network display

This program display the backpropagation during the training phase of an artifical neural network.
Every thing is done in C by using the SDL library. 
Writing a library to create artifical neural networks in C was challenging, especially because of the dynamic memory management.

The program is not perfect, but do what is expected to do.
The weight are updated in real time so it is possible to watch what are the modifications made during each run.

It is possible to create its own architecture by modifying the first parameters of the main.c file.
It is also possible to set a different number of input and outputs.

A file is given to run the program on both Linux and Windows.
